        San Francisco: the best and the worst.
    </h1>

    <h2>
        The Haight
    </h2>
    <p>
        <em>The Haight</em> is my <strong>favorite</strong> neighborhood because one of my favorite restaurants is on this street and I love the vibes from the people and the design elements.

    <h2>
        Financial District
    </h2>
    <p>
        <em>Financial District</em> is my <strong>least</strong> favorite simply because it is so overwhelmingly busy that I stay away unless I absolutely have to go. It seems like a good idea at first but once you get there you wish you would have just stayed home and ordered in. :P
